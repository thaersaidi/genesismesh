# Changelog

## v0.23.0 - Fleet Operations CLI

### Added

- Added a `genesis-mesh fleet` command group for operating a fleet of
  independent sovereign Network Authorities:
  - `fleet generate` scaffolds N sovereigns (root/NA/operator keys, a signed
    genesis block, and a per-NA `genesis-mesh.toml`) plus a `fleet.toml`
    manifest. Each NA is its own sovereign; adding one is a one-line manifest
    edit.
  - `fleet mesh` issues recognition treaties across every ordered pair so the
    fleet trusts itself, reusing federation bootstrap for review, signing, and
    trust-path verification. The operation is idempotent.
  - `fleet verify` confirms a trust-path resolves across every ordered pair.
  - `fleet status` reports `healthz`/`readyz` for each NA.
- Added `genesis_mesh/tests/test_cli_fleet.py` and CLI reference plus
  `docs/examples/edge-fleet.md` coverage for the new commands.

### Changed

- Bumped the package version to `0.23.0`.

### Notes

- The `fleet` commands are deterministic and API-driven; they do not start or
  stop processes. Production NAs run one-per-host under systemd or Kubernetes.
  Single-host dev/demo orchestration (start/stop/tunnels) lives in
  `ops/scripts/fleet.py`, which shares the same `fleet.toml` manifest format.
- The operator console `/cli-reference` page picks up the new group
  automatically from the Click command tree.

### Verified

- Ran the live `fleet generate` -> `na start` -> `fleet mesh` -> `fleet verify`
  flow across a generated three-NA fleet (all pairs trusted, re-mesh idempotent),
  the full CLI test suite, mypy, and the Sphinx docs build with warnings as
  errors.

## v0.22.0 - NBA Team-Operator Demo

### Added

- Added a synthetic two-sovereign demo of the "team as operator" pattern: two
  team-shaped Network Authorities (`BOS-NA`, `SAS-NA`) recognize each other
  through a signed treaty and propagate a revocation across that boundary.
- Added public demo artifacts under `examples/nba-demo-operators/` (signed
  genesis blocks, a validated trust bundle, the Connectome, and a redacted proof
  bundle).
- Added the `docs/examples/nba-team-operators.md` walkthrough and linked it from
  the adoption examples index.
- Linked the demo from the Aspayr NBA operator packet under `ops/nba/` as its
  technical proof point.

### Notes

- `BOS-NA` and `SAS-NA` are synthetic, locally generated demo sovereigns named
  after NBA cities to illustrate the operator pattern. They are not affiliated
  with, endorsed by, or operated by any NBA team, the NBA, or the NBPA, contain
  no real athlete data, and are deliberately kept out of the maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign
  sovereign fleet.

### Changed

- Bumped the package version to `0.22.0`.

### Verified

- Ran the live `proof remote` flow between the two demo authorities, the Sphinx
  docs build with warnings as errors, the full pre-push hook stage, and the
  package build.

## v0.21.2 - Operator Onboarding Status

### Added

- Added an "Onboarding and Initial Backers (proof pending)" section to the
  maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign documentation, recording that additional
  operators and backers are remaining prospective and preparing their own proof
  material.

### Changed

- Made the verification gate explicit: a participant is named in the operator
  cohort only when public proof artifacts (reachable endpoint, signed treaty,
  redacted proof bundle) are committed under `examples/`.
- Bumped the package version to `0.21.2`.

### Notes

- No organization, identity provider, or partner is named as an implementer or
  operator until its proof artifacts exist. This keeps the registry aligned with
  the future external-operator proof workflow rather than asserting unverified
  adoption.

### Verified

- Ran the Sphinx docs build with warnings as errors and the package build.

## v0.21.1 - RFC Prior Art and Design Lineage

### Added

- Added `docs/rfcs/prior-art.md` mapping each RFC to the established public
  standards it generalizes (X.509/PKI, SAML, OpenID Federation, OCSP,
  Certificate Transparency, DNS-SD, SPIFFE, and related prior art).
- Documented the protocol's distinct contribution: sovereign, portable trust
  with no permanent central authority, contrasted with federated identity.

### Changed

- Linked the prior-art lineage from the RFC index and added it to the RFC
  toctree.
- Bumped the package version to `0.21.1`.

### Notes

- The lineage document is design provenance, not an adoption record. It makes no
  claim that any organization, identity provider, or partner has implemented or
  endorsed Genesis Mesh; real third-party adoption remains gated on the
  future external-operator proof workflow.

### Verified

- Ran the Sphinx docs build with warnings as errors, the full pre-push hook
  stage, and the package build.

## v0.21.0 - RFC Program Batch 1

### Added

- Added the first batch of Genesis Mesh protocol RFCs under `docs/rfcs/`,
  covering sovereign identity, recognition treaties, trust bundles, revocation
  feeds, capability manifests, the Connectome model, operator continuity, and
  the managed operator role.
- Added an RFC index that records draft status and maps each RFC to its
  reference implementation module.
- Wired the RFC section into the documentation tree and linked it from the RFC
  program direction document.

### Changed

- Linked the RFC program's initial sequence to the published draft documents.
- Bumped the package version to `0.21.0`.

### Verified

- Ran pytest, mypy, compileall, the Sphinx docs build with warnings as errors,
  and the package build.

## v0.20.0 - Phase 2 Ecosystem Baseline

### Added

- Added the Phase 2 ecosystem baseline documentation for RFCs, Atlas,
  governance, independent implementation, and application-layer adoption.
- Added provenance documentation connecting the multi-cloud sovereign operation pattern
  to the current Genesis Mesh protocol and ecosystem baseline.
- Added development documentation for Atlas, governance baseline, and the RFC
  program.

### Changed

- Updated the roadmap and development history to make the Phase 2 ecosystem
  transition explicit after the v0.19.0 operator-continuity proof.
- Replaced the third-party large-file pre-push hook with a local stdlib hook so
  Windows Application Control policy does not block pushes.
- Restricted mutating formatting hooks to pre-commit so pre-push validation does
  not rewrite dirty working-tree docs.
- Bumped the package version to `0.20.0`.

### Verified

- Ran the full pre-push hook stage, including Sphinx docs and pytest.

## v0.19.0 - Operator Continuity

### Added

- Added the maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign registry to the operator
  documentation.
- Added continuity expectations for endpoint health, backups, treaty expiry
  review, trust-bundle refresh, recurring attestation and revocation proof, and
  Connectome checks.
- Added the v0.19.0 release plan and retrospective gate.

### Changed

- Linked the maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign fleet from public README and operator
  docs.
- Updated maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign metadata to describe ongoing active
  sovereign-operator continuity.
- Bumped the package version to `0.19.0`.

### Verified

- Validated maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign trust material.
- Ran Sphinx docs, pre-push hooks, package build, and release artifact checks.

## v0.18.0 - Official Operators

### Added

- Added official operator artifacts for the maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign proof.
- Added the maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign example directory and operator metadata.
- Added the v0.18.0 release plan and multi-cloud operation retrospective.

### Changed

- Updated the external operator adoption plan to record the shipped official
  operator proof and maintainer confirmation.
- Bumped the package version to `0.18.0`.

### Verified

- Validated operator JSON, public proof material, docs, tests, and release
  artifacts for the official-operator release.

## v0.17.11 - Azure Deployment Verification Hardening

### Changed

- Changed the Network Authority systemd unit to default production logs to
  JSON for Azure VM deployments.
- Changed the Azure release deployment workflow to use the repository virtual
  environment's Python interpreter for the Connectome probe instead of relying
  on a system `python` executable.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.11`.

### Verified

- Deployed the release to the Azure VM and probed the public Network Authority
  health, readiness, API reference, and Connectome surfaces.

## v0.17.10 - Observability and Operator UX Hardening

### Added

- Added first-class JSON log fields for Network Authority access and API error
  events so request metadata can be indexed without custom message parsing.
- Added `--operator-key` and `--operator-key-id` support to `genesis-mesh admin
  invite` and `genesis-mesh admin revoke`.
- Added `--config` as a short acceptor-config alias for `genesis-mesh
  federation bootstrap`.
- Added `--na` as the preferred alias for `genesis-mesh sovereign inspect`
  while keeping `--endpoint` compatible.

### Changed

- Applied the shared JSON formatter consistently across Genesis Mesh,
  Network Authority, Werkzeug, and Gunicorn loggers.
- Replaced the local `na start` Flask banner path with logger-based startup
  messages and Werkzeug serving so JSON log mode stays machine-readable in
  development smoke tests.
- Sanitized ANSI control sequences from structured log messages.
- Changed `genesis-mesh init --home <dir>` to write the generated config to
  `<dir>/genesis-mesh.toml` when `--config` is omitted.
- Made `genesis-mesh init --force` refuse to delete the current working tree
  with an explicit operator-facing error.
- Made federation bootstrap report persisted treaty state and cleanup guidance
  when post-issue trust-path verification fails.
- Updated CLI and configuration docs for the hardened operator flow.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.10`.

### Verified

- Ran focused CLI, federation, init, API error-contract, and observability
  logging tests.

## v0.17.9 - Observability Logging Hardening

### Added

- Added shared observability logging configuration under
  `genesis_mesh.observability.logging`.
- Added process-wide log redaction for common secret shapes, invite tokens,
  bearer tokens, signatures, passwords, private-key markers, and key file
  paths.
- Added Network Authority API access logging with request ID, method, path,
  status, duration, and remote address.
- Added logging tests for redaction, redacted exception tracebacks, and
  successful API request access logs.

### Changed

- Wired shared logging into CLI, node CLI, Network Authority CLI validation,
  and the production WSGI entrypoint.
- Removed duplicate route-level unexpected-exception logs so centralized API
  handlers own server-side failure logging.
- Added `GENESIS_LOG_LEVEL` and `GENESIS_LOG_FORMAT` defaults to systemd units.
- Updated monitoring documentation with logging configuration and redaction
  guidance.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.9`.

### Verified

- Ran the full Python test suite, focused API/logging tests, pre-commit hooks,
  compile checks, and Sphinx docs build with warnings treated as errors.

## v0.17.8 - API Error Contract Hardening

### Added

- Added shared Network Authority API exception classes and one JSON error
  envelope with machine-readable codes, safe messages, details, and request
  IDs.
- Added app-level Flask handlers for typed API errors, framework HTTP errors,
  Pydantic validation errors, and unexpected server exceptions.
- Added API contract tests for 400, 401, 404, 409, 422, 429, 500, response
  shape consistency, request ID propagation, and leak prevention.

### Changed

- Converted Network Authority routes to raise typed business failures instead
  of building repeated ad hoc JSON error responses inside controllers.
- Updated generated OpenAPI metadata and API reference docs to describe the
  shared error envelope.
- Kept CLI HTTP error rendering compatible with the new API error shape.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.8`.

### Verified

- Ran the full Python test suite and focused Network Authority route/API
  contract tests.

## v0.17.7 - CLI Error Handling Hardening

### Added

- Added shared CLI validation helpers for roles, positive validity windows,
  operator signing keys, and compact HTTP JSON error reporting.
- Added CLI error-handling tests for invalid roles, invalid expiry windows,
  missing operator keys, server-side validation responses, and mismatched
  join configuration.

### Changed

- Replaced traceback-prone `raise_for_status()` flows in operator CLI commands
  with consistent Click errors that preserve useful server messages.
- Hardened `admin invite`, `admin revoke`, `join`, `discover`,
  `sovereign inspect`, `federation bootstrap`, `trust-bundle`, `treaty`, and
  `proof remote` error paths.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.7`.

### Verified

- Ran the full Python test suite, pre-commit hooks, Sphinx docs build with
  warnings treated as errors, compile checks, command-tree help/invalid-option
  smoke tests, and a process-level local two-sovereign CLI smoke.

## v0.17.6 - Operator Console Trust View Polish

### Added

- Added live Network Authority screenshots for the Connectome and sovereign
  health dashboard documentation examples.
- Added a v0.17.6 maintainer plan for the operator console trust-view polish.

### Changed

- Refined the operator-facing Connectome story around current versus
  historical recognition edges and readable trust-state screenshots.
- Documented the dashboard's human-readable trust-change summaries alongside
  the repeatable generated demo assets.
- Updated the project history to include the v0.17.6 trust-view polish.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.6`.

### Verified

- Ran the full test suite, static type check, compile check, Sphinx docs build
  with warnings treated as errors, pre-commit hooks, and Azure deployment smoke
  after release.

## v0.17.5 - Sovereign Health and Trust Dashboard

### Added

- Added a read-only `/dashboard` operator page for local sovereign health and
  trust visibility.
- Added `/dashboard.json` with the same dashboard model for automation and
  independent verification.
- Added dashboard summary cards for readiness, Connectome counts, treaty
  warnings, revocation-feed freshness, and active nodes.
- Added treaty lifecycle, revocation-feed freshness, and recent sanitized
  trust-change sections to the operator dashboard.
- Added operator documentation plus a docs example with generated PNG/GIF
  assets for the sovereign health and trust dashboard.
- Added tests covering fresh dashboard empty state, JSON output, treaty state,
  audit visibility, and imported revocation feed rendering.

### Changed

- Added Dashboard to the operator console top navigation and generated HTTP
  surface metadata.
- Kept the dashboard read-only; it links to raw JSON and references but does not
  expose browser admin actions.
- Updated the v0.17.5 plan checklist to reflect completed implementation work.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.5`.

### Verified

- Ran focused dashboard/treaty tests and the full test suite.

  errors, and local HTTP smoke against a temporary Network Authority.

## v0.17.4 - Treaty Lifecycle Management

### Added

- Added `genesis-mesh treaty list`, `inspect`, `renew`, `replace`, and
  `revoke` operator commands for direct-recognition treaty lifecycle work.
- Added derived treaty lifecycle state and expiry-risk classification for
  active, expiring, expired, revoked, and replaced treaties without changing
  treaty semantics.
- Added lifecycle and expiry-risk visibility to Connectome recognition edges,
  including human-readable validity dates in the operator HTML view.
- Added operator documentation plus a docs example with generated PNG/GIF
  assets for treaty lifecycle management.
- Added focused CLI tests covering active, expired, revoked, renewed, replaced,
  and unknown treaty paths.

### Changed

- Updated Connectome active-edge calculation so expired, revoked, and replaced
  direct-recognition treaties do not count as active trust.
- Registered treaty lifecycle commands in the generated CLI reference and
  operator console surface metadata.
- Kept treaty renew and replace as helpers over existing issue and revoke
  semantics; no new treaty protocol primitive or schema migration was added.
- Updated the v0.17.4 plan checklist to reflect completed implementation work.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.4`.

### Verified

- Ran the full test suite, mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with
  warnings treated as errors, pre-commit, and `git diff --check`.

## v0.17.3 - Trust Bundle Exchange

### Added

- Added `genesis-mesh trust-bundle export` to package existing public sovereign
  trust material into a reviewable JSON bundle.
- Added `genesis-mesh trust-bundle inspect`, `validate`, and safe `import`
  workflows for offline review, live endpoint comparison, and local review
  receipts.
- Added `federation bootstrap --issuer-bundle` so a validated issuer bundle can
  seed federation review without granting trust automatically.
- Added operator documentation and a docs example with generated PNG/GIF assets
  for the trust-bundle and federation-bootstrap onboarding path.
- Added focused CLI tests covering export, inspect, validate, review import,
  live mismatch detection, unsupported versions, redaction, and bundle-backed
  federation review.

### Changed

- Registered trust-bundle commands in the generated CLI reference and operator
  console surface metadata.
- Kept trust bundles as a packaging layer over existing public endpoints; no
  new API endpoints, treaty semantics, or signed protocol artifact semantics
  were introduced.
- Updated the v0.17.3 plan checklist to reflect completed implementation work.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.3`.

### Verified

- Ran focused trust-bundle and federation tests.
- Ran the full test suite, mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with
  warnings treated as errors, and `git diff --check`.
- Ran a live non-mutating smoke from the local checkout against Azure USG and
  DigitalOcean USG-NB.

## v0.17.2 - Federation Bootstrap Readiness

### Added

- Added `genesis-mesh federation bootstrap` to review another sovereign,
  preview treaty scope, optionally issue a direct-recognition treaty, and
  verify the resulting trust path.
- Added redacted federation bootstrap evidence output for operator packets and
  proof bundles.
- Added operator documentation for federation bootstrap.
- Added focused CLI tests covering successful bootstrap, dry-run behavior,
  declined confirmation, failed preflight checks, and evidence redaction.

### Changed

- Registered federation bootstrap in the generated CLI reference and operator
  console surface metadata.
- Kept federation bootstrap as a CLI workflow over existing public and signed
  admin endpoints; no new API endpoints or treaty semantics were introduced.
- Ignored generated local sovereign homes and configs under `examples/genesis`.
- Updated the v0.17.2 plan checklist to reflect completed implementation work.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.2`.

### Verified

- Ran focused federation and CLI workflow tests.
- Ran adjacent Network Authority public/treaty tests.
- Ran the full test suite, mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with
  warnings treated as errors, pre-commit, and `git diff --check`.

## v0.17.1 - Large Module Refactor

### Added

- Added command-family CLI modules for initialization, proof operations,
  local development workflows, and shared CLI helpers.
- Added persistence-domain modules for Network Authority enrollment,
  CRL/policy state, audit/backup operations, sovereign trust state, and
  agent registrations.
- Added focused CLI operation test files plus shared CLI test helpers.
- Added a v0.17.1 release plan for the large-module refactor.
- Added a v0.18.0 plan preserving the multi-cloud sovereign operation proof
  milestone.

### Changed

- Reduced `genesis_mesh/cli/ops.py` to a smaller command registration and
  remaining operational command surface.
- Kept `genesis_mesh.na_service.db.NADatabase` as the stable public database
  facade while delegating persistence behavior to smaller mixins.
- Replaced the monolithic CLI ops test file with command-family test files.
- Updated the project history to reflect v0.17.0 as the documentation retheme
  and v0.17.1 as the maintainability refactor.
- Updated the v0.17.0 plan to describe the already-shipped documentation
  retheme release.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.1`.

### Verified

- Ran focused CLI, Network Authority, treaty, attestation, discovery, CRL,
  health, managed-operation, and database tests.
- Ran the full test suite, mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with
  warnings treated as errors, pre-commit, pre-push, `git diff --check`, and
  smoke tests across the changed CLI and database surfaces.

## v0.17.0 - Documentation Retheme and Navigation

### Added

- Added grouped documentation landing pages for deployment, runbooks, examples,
  adoption positioning, trust and sovereignty, and use-case walkthroughs.
- Added a public project history page under the Development documentation.
- Added Sphinx Design cards to the documentation home page for clearer entry
  points.
- Added sidebar scroll persistence for long documentation navigation.

### Changed

- Rethemed the Sphinx documentation to mirror the Network Authority operator
  console palette in light and dark modes.
- Flattened the Operators section and grouped Operations and Examples by reader
  intent.
- Updated the documentation logo treatment, sidebar captions, cards, code
  blocks, tables, and task lists to align with the operator console visual
  system.
- Renamed managed-sovereign documentation headings so operations and example
  pages are distinct.
- Bumped the package version to `0.17.0`.

### Verified

- Ran a clean Sphinx documentation build with warnings treated as errors.

## v0.16.2 - Operator Adoption Console

### Added

- Added a modular operator-console package with shared chrome, generated API
  metadata, generated CLI reference rendering, and a single protocol surface
  registry.
- Added `/swagger.json`, `/api-reference`, and `/cli-reference` to expose
  read-only operator and developer reference surfaces.
- Added package-owned console assets, including logo, favicon, shared
  `styles.css`, and shared `console.js`.
- Added dark/light mode support, client-side API/CLI search, home-page surface
  filters, and a scroll-to-top control.
- Added an operator-facing Connectome graph and a single useful empty state for
  fresh sovereigns.
- Added an Operators documentation landing page and made the docs theme use the
  Genesis Mesh logo.
- Added a v0.16.2 release plan for the operator adoption console.

### Changed

- Redesigned the Network Authority home page as a compact operator surface map
  instead of a flat route-card wall.
- Updated the Connectome page to share the same console chrome and to avoid
  rendering multiple empty diagnostic tables on fresh deployments.
- Updated generated API and CLI reference pages to use searchable, read-only
  reference tables without browser request execution.
- Updated the Azure VM deployment workflow to run from `main` with an explicit
  deploy ref, matching the existing Azure federated identity subject.
- Bumped the package version to `0.16.2`.

### Verified

- Ran the full test suite, mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with
  warnings treated as errors, pre-commit, pre-push, and `git diff --check`.

## v0.16.1 - Operator Console Surface Alignment

### Added

- Added shared operator-console styling for human-readable Network Authority
  pages.
- Added `AGENT.md` guidance requiring the home page, Connectome, and future
  operator pages to share one visual language and keep HTTP routes distinct
  from CLI-only workflows.
- Added a v0.16.1 release plan for operator console surface alignment.

### Changed

- Expanded the Network Authority home page to show current health, public
  trust, sovereign recognition, attestation, revocation, agent discovery,
  operator, and managed-operation surfaces.
- Updated the Connectome page to use the same visual standard as the Network
  Authority home page.
- Bumped the package version to `0.16.1`.

### Verified

- Added focused assertions for current homepage surfaces, CLI-only managed
  operations, and Connectome UI consistency.
- Ran focused Network Authority route tests, mypy, compileall, Sphinx
  documentation build with warnings treated as errors, and `git diff --check`.

## v0.16.0 - Managed Sovereign Enterprise Readiness

### Added

- Added `genesis-mesh managed backup` for consistent SQLite online backups of
  Network Authority databases.
- Added `genesis-mesh managed restore` for offline restore drills with backup
  validation, explicit `--yes` confirmation, and optional pre-restore copy.
- Added `genesis-mesh managed audit-export` for redacted JSONL/JSON export of
  Network Authority audit events.
- Added managed sovereign operations documentation covering backup/restore,
  audit export, monitoring thresholds, incident response, key custody models,
  and pilot-readiness checks.
- Added incident response runbooks for operator key compromise, NA key
  compromise, bad treaty issuance, bad feed import, database restore, and
  revocation blast-radius review.
- Added focused tests for backup/restore drill behavior, restore confirmation,
  backup validation, audit export filtering, and audit redaction.

### Changed

- Bumped the package version to `0.16.0`.
- Expanded CLI reference and operations documentation for managed-sovereign
  workflows.

### Verified

- Ran a non-production backup/restore drill through the managed CLI test path.
- Ran focused managed operations tests.
- Ran the full test suite, mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with
  warnings treated as errors, and `git diff --check`.

### Note

- This release makes a managed sovereign operationally credible for a pilot. It
  does not add billing, multi-tenancy, active-active HA, a governance UI, or an
  enterprise IdP bridge.
- The v0.17 external-operator multi-cloud operation proof remains separate and still
  requires a named future external operator.

## v0.15.0 - Supply-Chain Trust Gate

### Added

- Added a supply-chain maintainer attestation profile using the existing
  `MembershipAttestation` primitive with project ID, repository, delegated
  role, validity window, and release-maintainer role scope.
- Added `genesis-mesh supply-chain verify` for CI/release gates. The command
  verifies an attestation against a signed recognition treaty and optional
  sovereign revocation feeds.
- Added stable verifier exit codes: `0` for allow, `10` for deny, and `2` for
  verifier errors.
- Added compact redacted audit output and optional proof-bundle writing for CI
  artifacts.
- Added a sample GitHub Actions workflow for the supply-chain trust gate.
- Added supply-chain trust gate documentation, maintainer recruitment context,
  and a Sigstore/SLSA comparison.
- Added generated supply-chain trust gate JSON artifacts, PNG, and GIF assets.

### Changed

- Bumped the package version to `0.15.0`.
- Linked the supply-chain trust gate example from the documentation index,
  examples demo map, and CLI reference.

### Verified

- Added focused tests for accepted maintainer attestations, unknown issuers,
  disallowed roles, revoked attestations, stale revocation feeds, and CLI exit
  codes.
- Verified the checked-in demo artifacts with `genesis-mesh supply-chain
  verify`: allow before revocation and deny after revocation feed import.
- Ran the full test suite: `242 passed`.
- Ran mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with warnings treated as
  errors, and `git diff --check`.

### Note

- This release implements the supply-chain wedge. It does not replace package
  registries, transparency logs, Sigstore, SLSA, npm provenance, PyPI
  attestations, or GitHub artifact attestations.
- The v0.17 external-operator multi-cloud operation proof remains separate and still
  requires a named future external operator.

## v0.14.0 - External Operator Adoption Readiness

### Added

- Added adoption-proof metadata options to `genesis-mesh proof remote` so a
  proof bundle can distinguish maintainer-operated infrastructure from an
  external issuer operator.
- Added `--adoption-proof` validation requiring the issuer to be marked
  external and to confirm control of keys and infrastructure before a bundle is
  accepted as adoption evidence.
- Added operator packet documentation for external sovereign onboarding:
  security checklist, recognition playbook, and proof-bundle schema.
- Linked the operator packet from the documentation index and CLI reference.

### Verified

- Added focused tests for adoption-proof bundle metadata and weak-evidence
  rejection.
- Ran the full test suite: `236 passed`.
- Ran mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with warnings treated as
  errors, and `git diff --check`.

### Note

- This release ships the implementation and documentation needed for v0.14
  multi-cloud operation evidence. The external adoption milestone still
  requires a future external operator to run a sovereign with their own keys and
  infrastructure.

## v0.13.0 - Operator-Ready Sovereign Workflows

### Added

- Added explicit operator path options to `genesis-mesh init` for named
  sovereign setup on VMs: genesis path, NA key path, operator key paths,
  database path, bind host, and bind port.
- Added `GET /sovereign.json` as an operator-safe public metadata endpoint for
  network name, NA public key, validity window, and trust surfaces.
- Added `genesis-mesh sovereign inspect` for fetching public sovereign metadata
  from a live Network Authority.
- Added `genesis-mesh proof remote` to run the attestation -> treaty ->
  revocation proof against two live endpoints and optionally write a redacted
  proof bundle.
- Added `genesis-mesh proof cleanup` to back up a Network Authority SQLite DB
  and remove only proof artifacts without requiring the `sqlite3` CLI.
- Added an operator quickstart for standing up a named sovereign on an Ubuntu
  VM.
- Updated operator, VM bootstrap, API, and independent-sovereigns docs to use
  the supported v0.13 workflow.

### Changed

- `genesis-mesh na start` now honors the configured NA database path written by
  `genesis-mesh init --db-path`.
- `genesis-mesh init` now refuses production-style artifact paths with the
  default `USG` network name unless the operator explicitly passes
  `--network-name`.
- Agent discovery key routes now accept slash-ended base64 node keys without a
  Flask redirect.

### Verified

- Added focused tests for explicit init paths, sovereign metadata, proof
  cleanup, and the two-endpoint remote proof runner.
- Ran the full test suite: `234 passed`.
- Ran mypy, compileall, Sphinx documentation build with warnings treated as
  errors, and `git diff --check`.

## v0.12.1 - Independent Sovereigns Operational Proof

### Added

- Added an independent-sovereigns example documenting the Azure `USG` and
  DigitalOcean `USG-NB` proof.
- Added generated PNG/GIF assets for the independent-sovereigns proof.
- Added a transcript renderer with explicit live mode for rerunning the proof
  against live Network Authority endpoints.
- Added a provider-neutral Ubuntu VM bootstrap script and documented the
  generic VM/VPS setup path.

### Verified

- Verified the clean Azure + DigitalOcean proof from empty Connectome state:
  NB issued an attestation, Azure recognized NB through a signed treaty, Azure
  accepted the attestation, NB revoked it, Azure imported NB's signed feed, and
  Azure rejected the same attestation.
- Ran compileall for the new proof script.
- Ran the Sphinx documentation build with warnings treated as errors.
- Ran `git diff --check`.

## v0.12.0 - Connectome Visualization and Operator Workflows

### Added

- Ran the orchestration smoke workflow with a temporary Network Authority, two
  `repo.summary` providers, one `llm.chat` provider, one `planner.answer`
  provider, and a researcher.
- Verified the researcher used no configured node keys, peer endpoints,
  provider identities, or provider hosts.
