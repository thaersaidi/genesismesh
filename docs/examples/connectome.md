# Example: Connectome Operator View

The Connectome turns recognition graph data into an operator-facing view of
sovereigns, direct-recognition edges, trust paths, and revocation impact. It is
not a new trust source. It is a window over the signed treaties and imported
revocation feeds already stored by the Network Authority.

    graph["/recognition-graph"]
    json["/connectome.json"]

    operator["Operator"]

    graph --> json

    operator --> path
```

## What This Proves

- Operators can inspect the recognition network without reading raw treaty
  JSON.
- Active and revoked recognition edges are visible from the same source of
  truth.
- A direct trust-path check explains whether one sovereign currently recognizes
  another.
- Imported sovereign revocation feeds expose their blast radius: which
  accepting sovereigns are affected by a revoked membership attestation.

## Endpoints

### `GET /connectome.json`

Returns a derived Connectome view:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "sovereign_count": 2,
    "recognition_edge_count": 1,
    "active_edge_count": 1,
    "revoked_edge_count": 0,
    "revoked_trust_material_count": 1,
    "imported_revocation_count": 1
  },
  "recognition_edges": [
    {
      "from": "sovereign-a",
      "to": "sovereign-b",
      "status": "active",
      "treaty_id": "..."
    }
  ],
  "revocation_blast_radius": [
    {
      "type": "membership_attestation",
      "issuer_sovereign_id": "sovereign-b",
      "affected_accepting_sovereigns": ["sovereign-a"],
      "reason": "key_compromise"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /connectome/trust-path`

Explains whether one sovereign currently recognizes another:

```text
GET /connectome/trust-path?from=sovereign-a&to=sovereign-b
```

Response:

```json
{
  "from": "sovereign-a",
  "to": "sovereign-b",
  "trusted": true,
  "reason": "active_treaty_path",
  "hop_count": 1,
  "path": [
    {
      "from": "sovereign-a",
      "to": "sovereign-b",
      "status": "active",
      "treaty_id": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

If the direct treaty was revoked, the endpoint returns
`trusted: false` with `reason: direct_treaty_revoked`. If no active path exists,
it returns `reason: no_active_treaty_path`.

### `GET /connectome`

Renders a self-contained HTML operator page with summary cards, recognition
edges, revoked trust material, and revocation blast-radius rows. The page links
back to `/recognition-graph` and `/connectome.json` so operators can compare
the derived view with the raw export.

## Run the Demo

```powershell
python docs\examples\assets\scripts\connectome-demo.py
```

The demo creates two in-process Network Authorities:

1. Sovereign B issues a membership attestation.
2. Sovereign A issues an active recognition treaty for Sovereign B.
3. Sovereign B revokes the attestation and publishes a signed revocation feed.
4. Sovereign A imports the feed.
5. The Connectome view reports the active recognition edge and the imported
   revocation's affected accepting sovereigns.

To inspect the operator page in a browser, run the same seeded flow in server
mode:

```powershell
python docs\examples\assets\scripts\connectome-demo.py --serve --port 8765
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/connectome
```

The server exposes the same seeded graph at `/connectome.json` and the direct
trust-path explanation at
`/connectome/trust-path?from=sovereign-a&to=sovereign-b`.

The screenshot above shows the deployed Network Authority view with multiple
sovereigns, aggregated graph edges, split current and historical recognition
tables, and readable treaty dates. The generated demo image below remains the
repeatable local proof asset.

## Expected Proof

```text
==> Connectome summary
    sovereigns:              2
    recognition edges:       1
    active edges:            1
    imported revocations:    1

==> Direct trust path
    from:    sovereign-a
    to:      sovereign-b
    trusted: True
    reason:  active_treaty_path

==> Revocation blast radius
    revoked attestation: <attestation-id>
    issuer:              sovereign-b
    affected acceptors:  sovereign-a
    reason:              key_compromise
```

## Design Boundary

The Connectome is deliberately read-only. It visualizes and explains trust
state, but the authoritative records remain signed treaties, signed
attestations, imported signed revocation feeds, and the local Network Authority
database.
