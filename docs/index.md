# Genesis Mesh

Genesis Mesh is a sovereign trust, identity, and communication fabric for AI
agents, edge systems, and distributed infrastructure.

It is built for networks where every participant must be known, enrolled,
authenticated, authorized, reachable, and revocable. The project is not only a
message transport. Unlike traditional mesh networks that focus mainly on
connectivity, Genesis Mesh focuses on controlled participation, cryptographic
identity, policy enforcement, and operator-owned trust.

It combines identity, trust, routing, authorization, and network ownership into
one control model so operators can answer:

- Who is allowed to be a node?
- How do peers prove they are who they claim to be?
- What is each node allowed to do?
- How do messages reach the right peer?
- How do I remove a compromised or retired identity?

The system has two planes. The Network Authority is the online control plane: it
issues invite tokens, signs join certificates, publishes policy, and distributes
certificate revocation lists. Mesh nodes are the data plane: after enrollment,
they authenticate each other with certificates, establish encrypted Noise XX
peer sessions, exchange routing information, and forward messages across the
mesh.

Use Genesis Mesh when you need decentralized communication without anonymous
membership: private AI-agent networks, edge-service fabrics, lab environments,
sovereign organizational networks, distributed compute clusters, and other
deployments where operators must be able to admit, audit, route, authorize, and
remove nodes.

It is not a public blockchain, anonymous overlay, or permissionless discovery
network. Trust begins with a signed genesis block, flows through the Network
Authority, and is enforced by short-lived certificates, operator-signed admin
actions, and revocation checks.

## Why Genesis Mesh?

Most mesh networks answer one question: can nodes communicate?

Genesis Mesh answers the harder operational questions: can nodes communicate
securely, prove their identity, follow policy, be audited, and be removed when
trust is lost?

**Genesis Mesh is closest to a sovereign zero-trust control plane combined with
decentralized peer routing.** It is not just a connectivity overlay; it is a
trust fabric for permissioned node and agent networks.

Genesis Mesh is designed for environments where connectivity alone is
insufficient and trust must be continuously established, enforced, and
revocable.

## Typical Use Cases

- AI agent networks that require identity, authorization, and revocation.
- Edge computing platforms operating across multiple locations.
- Sovereign organizational networks that cannot rely on third-party control
  planes.
- Distributed compute clusters with operator-controlled membership.
- Research and laboratory environments requiring strong enrollment controls.

## Five Operating Pillars

- **Identity**: every node has a cryptographic identity and a signed join
  certificate.
- **Trust**: a signed genesis block, Network Authority, operator keys, CRLs, and
  policy manifests define the trust chain.
- **Routing**: authenticated peers exchange routing state and forward messages
  without sending all traffic through the Network Authority.
- **Authorization**: enrollment roles, RBAC, signed admin actions, and policy
  updates define what identities can do.
- **Sovereignty**: the operator owns the genesis block, trust anchors, policy,
  enrollment process, and revocation authority instead of delegating network
  membership to a third-party control plane.

## Documentation Build

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python -m sphinx -b html -W docs docs/pages
```

In Git Bash on Windows:

```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python -m sphinx -b html -W docs docs/pages
```

The generated site is written to `docs/pages`.

To preview the site locally, serve `docs/pages` as the HTTP root:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000 --directory docs/pages
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/`. If you serve the repository root or `docs/`
instead, `/` and `/concepts/architecture.html` will return 404 because the
generated `index.html` lives under `docs/pages`.
