## Live Message Delivery

A remote local node sends a DATA message to an Azure-hosted node over a Noise XX encrypted peer session.

![Genesis Mesh live message delivery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thaersaidi/genesismesh/main/docs/examples/assets/images/genesis-mesh-message-delivery.gif)

- Noise XX handshake completed
- Connection established
- Neighbor added
- DATA message delivered

## Multi-Hop Routing

Genesis Mesh supports decentralized route propagation and packet forwarding.

Node A and Node C do not connect directly. Instead:

**Node A → Node B → Node C**

Node B learns routes, forwards packets, and decrements TTL values during transit.

![Genesis Mesh multi-hop routing demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thaersaidi/genesismesh/main/docs/examples/assets/images/genesis-mesh-multi-hop.gif)

- Route learned via intermediate node
- DATA forwarded by router
- DATA delivered to destination

## Route Failure Recovery

When a router goes offline, neighboring nodes withdraw its routes and traffic re-routes through a surviving path — no operator intervention.

**Topology:** A reaches C through two routers — B (primary) and D (backup). B is killed mid-demo.

![Genesis Mesh route failure recovery demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thaersaidi/genesismesh/main/docs/examples/assets/images/genesis-mesh-failover.gif)

- Primary path A → B → C delivers
- B goes offline
- A detects the disconnect and invalidates B's routes
- A → D → C delivers without retry or operator action


![Genesis Mesh revocation demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thaersaidi/genesismesh/main/docs/examples/assets/images/genesis-mesh-revocation.gif)

**Trust can be revoked.**

A revoked node is removed from the active set, added to a signed CRL, and
immediately rejected by heartbeat, renewal, handshake, and routing checks.

Genesis Mesh treats revocation as a first-class control-plane action. When an
operator revokes a certificate, the Network Authority publishes a new signed
CRL, removes the node from the active set, and rejects further heartbeat,
renewal, peer handshake, and routing activity from that identity.

---

Genesis Mesh is a sovereign trust, identity, and communication fabric for AI
agents, edge systems, and distributed infrastructure.

It answers the operational questions that basic mesh networking leaves open:
who is allowed to be a node, how peers prove identity, what each node is
allowed to do, how messages reach the right peer, and how a compromised or
retired identity is removed.

Genesis Mesh combines five capabilities in one trust fabric:

- **Identity**: every node has an Ed25519 identity and a signed join certificate.
- **Trust**: a signed genesis block, Network Authority, operator keys, and CRLs
  define who the network trusts.
- **Routing**: authenticated peers discover routes and forward messages without
  depending on the Network Authority for every data exchange.
- **Authorization**: enrollment roles, policy manifests, RBAC, and signed admin
  actions define what identities may do.
- **Sovereignty**: the operator owns the trust chain, membership process,
  revocation process, and policy distribution path.

Every enrolled node holds a signed join certificate issued by the Network
Authority. Peer sessions are encrypted with the Noise XX protocol, deriving
X25519 keys directly from each node's Ed25519 identity. No separate TLS
certificate lifecycle is required for peer transport.

## Why It Exists

Most overlay networks focus on connectivity: can this machine reach that
machine? Genesis Mesh focuses on controlled participation: should this machine
be here, what identity is it using, what is it authorized to do, and can the
network remove it quickly?

Use Genesis Mesh when your system needs:

- a private trust domain for agents, devices, or edge services
- operator-controlled enrollment instead of open peer discovery
- certificate-backed peer authentication
- signed policy distribution
- revocation that affects heartbeats, renewal, peer handshakes, and routing
- audit trails for security-relevant control-plane actions

Do not use it when you only need public peer discovery, anonymous networking, a
general service mesh for Kubernetes ingress, or a permissionless blockchain.

```

At a high level, the Network Authority admits identities and publishes trust
state. Nodes use that state to communicate directly, route messages, and reject
revoked peers.

## Maintainer-Operated Multi-Cloud Sovereigns

v0.18.0 records the maintainer-operated multi-cloud sovereign fleet. The fleet
proves separate sovereign identities, keys, endpoints, treaties, revocation
feeds, and public trust material across multiple cloud providers. It is
operational portability proof, not third-party adoption proof. Public artifacts
are under
[`examples/reference-sovereign-operators/`](examples/reference-sovereign-operators/README.md)
and [`examples/official-operators/`](examples/official-operators/README.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or later
- See `requirements.txt` for pinned runtime dependencies

## Installation

```bash
pip install genesis-mesh
```

For development from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thaersaidi/genesismesh.git
cd genesismesh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # PowerShell: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
```

## Quick Start

The local workflow runs the NA in one terminal and joins a node in a second.

```bash
# Create keys, genesis block, and CLI config (one time).
genesis-mesh init

# Start the Network Authority (keep this terminal open).
genesis-mesh na start

# In a second terminal: create a single-use invite and join.
INVITE_TOKEN=$(genesis-mesh admin invite --role anchor)
genesis-mesh join --na http://127.0.0.1:8443 --token "$INVITE_TOKEN"

# Inspect NA health and node certificate state.
genesis-mesh status
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$INVITE_TOKEN = genesis-mesh admin invite --role anchor
genesis-mesh join --na http://127.0.0.1:8443 --token $INVITE_TOKEN
```

Full local smoke test:

```bash
genesis-mesh dev up
```

## Production Deployment

Container startup uses `start.sh` and Gunicorn. Set `SERVICE_ROLE=na` for the
Network Authority or `SERVICE_ROLE=node` for a peer node. The NA role requires
two mounted secrets and fails closed if either is absent:

| Environment variable      | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `SERVICE_ROLE`            | `na` or `node`                                   |
| `GENESIS_FILE`            | Path to the signed genesis block                 |
| `NA_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`     | Path to the NA Ed25519 signing key (NA role)     |
| `OPERATOR_PUBLIC_KEYS_JSON` | JSON map of operator key IDs to public keys   |
| `DB_PATH`                 | SQLite database path (default: `genesis_mesh_na.db`) |
| `PORT`                    | Bind port (default: `8443`)                      |
| `WEB_CONCURRENCY`         | Gunicorn worker count (default: `4`)             |

The NA private key never leaves the NA process.

Health and readiness probes are available at `/healthz` and `/readyz`.

## Application Examples

- **Agent network** — two agents (a researcher and a knowledge base) hold a structured conversation over the mesh. The responder's identity is unforgeable, the conversation is private, and revoking the responder blocks further answers. See [`examples/agent-network/`](examples/agent-network/README.md). Easy to extend to an LLM, database, or MCP backend without changing the mesh code.

## Deployment Examples

Genesis Mesh includes deployment examples for:

- **Local process** — `genesis-mesh init && genesis-mesh na start`
- **Docker** — `docker run` and Docker Compose (`docs/examples/compose/`)
- **Cloudflare Containers** — `wrangler deploy` with the Worker/container
  binding in `wrangler.jsonc`
- **Kubernetes** — manifests under `examples/kubernetes/`
- **Terraform on Azure** — `infrastructure/azure/`, the same module used by the live deployment

See the [deployment guide](https://genesismesh.connectorzzz.com/operations/deployment.html) for the full walkthrough.

Cloudflare Containers deploy the Docker image through the Worker defined in
`src/cloudflare-worker.js`. The first container-backed test case is `EPICAL-NA`.
Before deploying it, store the NA private key and signed genesis block as Worker
secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put NA_PRIVATE_KEY
npx wrangler secret put GENESIS_JSON
npx wrangler deploy
```
